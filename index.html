          <h2>Simple React application</h2>
          An application in React is a dynamic and interactive web application built using the React JavaScript library. 
          React allows developers to create user interfaces by composing reusable UI components. <br>
          React applications are built using components, which are self-contained, reusable UI elements that can be composed together to create complex interfaces. <br>
          React uses a virtual DOM to efficiently update the UI. When data changes, React compares the virtual DOM with the actual DOM and only updates the parts of the UI that have changed, resulting in faster performance. <br>
          React components can have state, which is used to manage data that can change over time. State allows components to be dynamic and interactive. <br>
          Props are used to pass data from parent to child components in React. They are read-only and help to maintain the immutability of data in the application. <br>
          React components have lifecycle methods that allow developers to hook into the various stages of a component's life, such as when it is rendered, updated, or unmounted. <br>
          React applications typically use a routing library, such as React Router, to handle navigation between different pages or views within the application. <br>
          React applications often fetch data from a server or API using libraries like Axios or the built-in fetch API. This data can then be used to update the UI. <br>
